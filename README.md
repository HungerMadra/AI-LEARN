Building a Large Language Model from Scratch - Follow Along

📌 About This Repository

This repository documents my journey as I study "Building a Large Language Model from Scratch" by Sebastian Raschka. I am implementing the concepts and coding exercises as I progress through the material, sharing my insights, challenges, and learnings along the way.

🚀 Objectives

Gain a deep understanding of how LLMs are built from the ground up.

Implement core components of an LLM, including tokenization, embedding layers, and transformer architectures.

Experiment with different training techniques and optimizations.

Share my code, findings, and notes to help others who are on the same journey.

📖 Topics Covered

As I progress, I'll be updating this section with key topics I’ve implemented:

Understanding Tensors & PyTorch Basics ✅

Tokenization & Preprocessing 🔄 (In Progress)

Building the Neural Network Foundations

Implementing Attention Mechanisms

Transformers & Self-Attention

Training & Fine-Tuning an LLM

Deploying & Evaluating the Model

🛠 How to Use This Repo
